This respository contains the software to create a GUI Throttle that uses a serial interface to a Digitrax Loconet PR3 Decoder Programmer.  The software for the GUI was developed on a PC running Ubuntu 16.04 using Qt5.  The loconet support software is contained in the folder LocoNet/src.  The gui software is contained in the folder QtLoconet/src. Although this has not been tried it would be interesting to see if that this software would work on the newer PR4.  The next step is to run this on a Raspberry PI 3B+.
